- Roles are usually associated with a **job title** or **position title**, indicating the person‚Äôs place in the organization.
    

---

## üî∑ **RACI Chart**

A **RACI chart** helps clarify roles and responsibilities for a task or process. The four roles defined in a RACI model are:

|**Role**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Responsible (R)**|The person or group who actually performs the work or task.|
|**Accountable (A)**|The person who is ultimately answerable for ensuring the work is complete, accurate, and timely. Usually manages the Responsible party.|
|**Consulted (C)**|People or groups who provide opinions, expertise, or insights. They are consulted because they are stakeholders or subject matter experts. Communication is **two-way**.|
|**Informed (I)**|People or groups who are kept informed about the progress or completion of the task. Communication is **one-way**.|

---

### ‚úÖ **Considerations when assigning RACI roles:**

- **Skills**
    
    - Assigned individuals or groups must have the necessary skills, training, and competence.
        
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD)**
    
    - Critical tasks should be divided among multiple individuals or groups to prevent conflict or abuse.
        
    - Example: Requestor, approver, and provisioner of user accounts cannot all be the same person or group.
        
- **Conflict of Interest**
    
    - Tasks must not be assigned to individuals or groups where it would create a conflict of interest.
        
    - Example: A user cannot approve their own access request.

### üìñ Notes on the RACI roles:

- **Responsible (R):** Does the work. (e.g., Risk Manager, Security Auditor)
    
- **Accountable (A):** Owns the outcome. Only one per activity. (e.g., CISO, QA Manager)
    
- **Consulted (C):** Gives input & expertise; two-way communication. (e.g., Business Owners, Legal)
    
- **Informed (I):** Kept updated; one-way communication. (e.g., Executives, Employee


## üìå **Strategy and Objectives**

A **strategy** is the **plan** designed to achieve an **objective**.  
An **objective (or objectives)** refers to the desired future state of the organization‚Äôs security posture and level of risk.

However, a **strategy** itself also has specific **objectives**, which include:

- üîó **Business alignment**  
    The desired future state and the strategy must align with the organization‚Äôs overall business strategy and objectives.
    
- üéØ **Risk appetite alignment**  
    The security program implicitly drives the organization toward a certain level of risk, which must align with the organization‚Äôs actual risk appetite.
    
- üõ°Ô∏è **Effective risk management**  
    A security program must include risk management policies, processes, and procedures. Without these, decisions are made blindly without understanding their consequences or the level of risk.
    
- üí∞ **Value delivery**  
    The future state of the security program should focus on continual improvement and increasing efficiency ‚Äî reducing risk at the lowest reasonable cost, since no organization has unlimited funds for security.
    
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Resource optimization**  
    Strategic goals should efficiently utilize available resources. This means having only the necessary staff and tools required to meet objectives.
    
- üìà **Performance measurement**  
    Strategic objectives should be SMART ‚Äî Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-related. Ongoing security operations should also be measurable to drive continual improvement.
    
- üîÑ **Assurance process integration**  
    Organizations often operate multiple assurance processes in silos. An effective strategy works to break down these silos, consolidate assurance processes, and reduce hidden risks.
    

---

## üë• **Key Contributors to Developing an Effective, Business-Aligned Strategy**

The most important resources for developing a security strategy are the opinions, observations, and analytical insights of several key personnel in the organization:

- üèõÔ∏è **Board of Directors**  
    With explicit responsibility for setting the organization‚Äôs risk appetite, board members must clearly understand the level of risk they desire. Even if no formal risk appetite has been defined, board members will have implicit or explicit opinions on the matter.
    
- üëî **Executive Management**  
    As the personnel responsible for corporate governance, executives‚Äô decisions reflect their attitudes about risk ‚Äî whether implicit or explicit, conscious or subconscious.
    
- üîê **Security Leader**  
    An experienced security leader must be an effective communicator who can "sell" the strategy to business leaders.  
    It‚Äôs not enough to understand information security deeply ‚Äî the leader must convince those controlling resources (executives and board members) of the value and necessity of the strategy for it to succeed.
    
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Team**  
    Security team members must collaborate with each other and with others in the organization to contribute to developing the details of the strategy. They need to be familiar with their specialties in information security, recognize areas that need improvement, and clearly articulate them to leaders.
    
- üìä **Business Leaders**  
    The security leader must collaborate with business leaders to understand their business models, strategies, goals, objectives, and operations. Without this knowledge, the security strategy risks misalignment with the organization‚Äôs needs.
    
- üë∑ **Rank-and-File Employees**  
    Many individual contributors possess critical knowledge and valuable insights that can help craft an effective strategy. The security leader‚Äôs challenge is to identify and collaborate with these individuals to understand their perspectives on information security.
    
- üåê **Outside Experts**  
    A strong security leader maintains a trusted network of experienced professionals and mentors for advice and feedback ‚Äî even accomplished leaders benefit from external guidance when developing strategies.


## üìú **Security Policy**

A **security policy** can be thought of as an organization‚Äôs **internal laws and regulations** regarding the protection of important assets (including personnel safety).

By examining the current security policy, you can learn a lot about what behaviors are expected in the organization. Below are some key aspects of a good security policy:

### ‚ú® Key Aspects of a Security Policy

- üìã **Breadth of Coverage**
    
    - What subject areas does the policy cover?
        
    - Does it include expectations about computer and mobile device usage?
        
    - Does it also address topics like vulnerability management, third-party risk, or secure software development?
        
- üîó **Relevance**
    
    - Does the policy include content that reflects new technologies and practices?
        
    - Or is it outdated and not aligned with current threats and operations?
        
- üì£ **Policy Communication**
    
    - How well is the policy communicated to the workforce?
        
    - How frequently is it shared or reinforced?
        
    - What is the level of understanding of the policy among employees?
        
- üåç **Workforce Transformation**
    
    - Does the policy address shifts toward remote work, which many organizations have experienced?
        
    - Topics may include:
        
        - Remote access and VPN use.
            
        - Home network security.
            
        - Physical security while working remotely.
            
        - Travel-related risks.
            
        - Applicability of employment laws when employees relocate to another city, state, or country.
            
- üîí **Policy Strictness**
    
    - Does the policy broadly prohibit certain behaviors (e.g., occasional personal use of corporate email)?
        
    - Does it limit or forbid the use of external USB storage devices?
        
- üìù **Accountability and Consequences**
    
    - Does the policy clearly specify expectations for adherence?
        
    - Does it define consequences for willingly violating the policy, such as suspension or termination of employment?
        
- ‚úÖ **Compliance**
    
    - Does the organization comply with its own policy?
        
    - To what degree?
        
    - Does the policy reflect good practices that are actually implemented, or is it more of an aspirational ‚Äúvision statement‚Äù about how things _could_ be?
        
- üïí **Last Management Review**
    
    - When was the policy last updated, reviewed, and approved by management?
        
    - This speaks to how active and engaged the organization‚Äôs security program has been in recent times.
        

---

## üîß **Standards**

While the **security policy** provides high-level rules and expectations, the organization‚Äôs **security standards** describe **in detail** the methods and specifications that must be used.

### ‚ú® Key Aspects of Security Standards

- Define:
    
    - The methods, techniques, and technologies.
        
    - Specifications, brands, and configurations.
        
- Should align closely with the security policy.
    
- Like the policy, it‚Äôs important to understand:
    
    - **Breadth of coverage**
        
    - **Strictness**
        
    - **Compliance**
        
    - **Last review and update**
        

Standards ensure consistency across the organization and facilitate adherence to the security policy by specifying _how_ to implement it.



## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Debt**

**Technical debt** refers to weaknesses and deficiencies in an organization‚Äôs infrastructure that accumulate over time, making it harder and more expensive to maintain, extend, or improve the environment.

It reflects two main characteristics of an organization‚Äôs infrastructure:

### üî∑ **1. Poor Design**

- The infrastructure lacks an overall cohesive design or is built on a flawed design.
    
- This forces subsequent additions and changes to the environment to be made in a less-than-optimal way.
    
- Over time, this further degrades the environment in terms of:
    
    - Performance
        
    - Resilience
        
    - Simplicity
        
- Examples:
    
    - Ad-hoc deployment of systems without proper planning.
        
    - Overly complex architectures due to patchwork solutions.
        

---

### üî∑ **2. Outdated and Unsupported Components**

- Major hardware or software components have exceeded their service life.
    
- Components are no longer supported by their manufacturers.
    
- Some subcomponents cannot be easily replaced because they are obsolete or proprietary.
    
- This results in higher risks (e.g., security vulnerabilities) and higher costs to maintain.
    

---

## üìñ **The Metaphor: Technical Debt as Financial Debt**

The term **technical debt** is a metaphor for financial debt because it has two key parallels:

- üìà **‚ÄúInterest Payments‚Äù**
    
    - Every time the environment needs attention, more effort is required because of the existing inefficiencies.
        
    - This increases the cost, time, and difficulty of ongoing maintenance and upgrades.
        
- üí∞ **‚ÄúRetiring the Debt‚Äù**
    
    - To eliminate technical debt, major architectural changes or replacement of many components are often required.
        
    - This is akin to paying off the principal of a loan.
        

---

## üìä **Causes of Technical Debt**

- Lack of personnel capable of creating good architectural designs.
    
- Failing to upgrade or replace end-of-life (EOL) components.
    
- Organizational decisions to delay proper investments in infrastructure design for short-term gains.
    

---

## üìâ **Data Debt**

A related concept is **data debt**, which refers to deficiencies in an organization‚Äôs **data models and data management practices**.

- In organizations burdened by data debt:
    
    - Data models are no longer aligned with the business.
        
    - Data becomes inconsistent, incomplete, redundant, or outdated.
        
    - This hinders effective use of data for business operations, analytics, and decision-making.
        

---

### ‚ú® Summary Table

|**Aspect**|**Impact**|
|---|---|
|**Poor Design**|Inefficient changes, degraded performance/resilience|
|**Outdated Components**|Security, support, and replacement challenges|
|**Interest Payments**|Increased effort & cost over time|
|**Retiring the Debt**|Requires major overhaul or redesign|
|**Data Debt**|Business misalignment of data models and poor data quality|
## üîç Vulnerability Management

Organizations must have **effective vulnerability management programs** to minimize risks from threats (e.g., malware).  
A typical **vulnerability management life-cycle process** includes the following 4 steps:

### üìã Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Identify the environment to be scanned**

- Determine which systems, networks, and assets are in scope.
    
- Build an inventory of what needs to be monitored.
    

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scan the assets for vulnerabilities**

- Use automated scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    
- Scans can be internal, external, authenticated, or unauthenticated.
    

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Identify and categorize vulnerabilities**

- Assess the findings from the scan.
    
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and business impact (often mapped to CVSS scores, or similar).
    

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Remediate vulnerabilities**

- Usually done through:
    
    - Applying security patches
        
    - Making configuration changes
        
    - Increasing monitoring & alerting in some cases where immediate fixes aren‚Äôt possible.
        

---

## üìñ Risk Register

A **risk register** (also called a **risk ledger**) is a critical business record used to document, track, and analyze risks over time.  
It provides valuable insights into the risk management and risk analysis activities of an organization.

### üìù What can a strategist learn from the risk register?

- **Scope, frequency, quality, and maturity of risk assessments**
    
    - How often are risk assessments performed?
        
    - How comprehensive and consistent are they?
        
- **Presence or absence of risk treatment**
    
    - Are risks being actively managed and mitigated, or left unresolved?
        
- **Security incidents**
    
    - Patterns of past incidents and how they were addressed.
        

A risk register reflects the **history and findings** from:

- Risk assessments
    
- Threat assessments
    
- Vulnerability assessments
    
- Security incidents
    
- Other related activities.
    

üìå **Key Insight:**  
If an organization lacks a risk register, it suggests that its security management program is _not_ taking a risk-based approach ‚Äî a significant weakness.

---

## üî∑ Operational Maturity

By analyzing the **consistency of vulnerabilities** among similar systems, you can gauge the organization‚Äôs **operational maturity**.

- If vulnerability assessments show:
    
    - üé≤ **Inconsistency in vulnerabilities**
        
        - Example: Similar systems show very different vulnerabilities.
            
        - Likely cause: No standardized configurations and no automation tools.
            
        - Indicates patching and configuration are done _ad hoc_.
            
    - üîÑ **Consistency in vulnerabilities**
        
        - Example: Similar systems exhibit the same vulnerabilities.
            
        - Likely cause: Use of standardized configurations and automated tools.
            
        - Indicates higher operational maturity and better system management processes.
            

---

## üî∑ Security Maturity

The **range and age of vulnerabilities** among systems also reveals the **maturity of the vulnerability management program**.

- Signs of low security maturity:
    
    - Large numbers of unpatched vulnerabilities.
        
    - Presence of high and critical vulnerabilities that are many months (or years) old.
        
    - Inconsistent or neglected patch management.
        
    - Indicates that vulnerability management has low priority or insufficient resources.
        
- Signs of higher security maturity:
    
    - Vulnerabilities are promptly identified and remediated.
        
    - Few or no old high-risk vulnerabilities remain.
        
    - Regular and systematic patching and configuration updates.
        
    - Reflects good emphasis on basic **security hygiene**.
        

---

### üìù Summary Table

|**Aspect**|**Mature Organization**|**Immature Organization**|
|---|---|---|
|**Risk Register**|Maintained, updated, comprehensive|Missing or neglected|
|**Operational Maturity**|Standardized configurations, automation used|Ad-hoc processes, inconsistent systems|
|**Security Maturity**|Few, recent, low-risk vulnerabilities|Many, old, high-risk vulnerabilities|
# üìÑ Cyber-Insurance in Security Strategy

Organizations sometimes purchase a **cyber-insurance policy** as part of their risk management and governance strategy.  
A strategist reviewing this decision should explore the underlying reasons and evaluate how the policy aligns with the organization‚Äôs security posture and needs.

---

## üéØ Possible Reasons for Cyber-Insurance

‚úî **Compliance**

- The organization may be required by **law, regulation, or standard** to have a cyber-insurance policy.
    
- Example: Certain financial or healthcare regulations may mandate it.
    

‚úî **Customer Requirement**

- A **key customer** (e.g., a government agency or large corporation) may require vendors or partners to carry cyber-insurance as a condition of doing business.
    

‚úî **Prior Incidents**

- A **costly incident in the past** (such as a ransomware attack, data breach, or lawsuit) may have led the organization to purchase insurance to reduce future financial exposure.
    
- Alternatively, a similar incident affecting another company known to management may have influenced the decision, as a precaution.
    

‚úî **Risk Treatment**

- Part of a formal **risk management strategy**, where the organization decides to **transfer risk** (instead of mitigating or accepting it) by purchasing insurance.
    

---

## üîç Key Questions to Consider about the Policy

When reviewing a cyber-insurance policy, a strategist should evaluate it critically. Here are some **important questions to ask:**

### üõë Ransomware Coverage

- Under what conditions will the insurance company pay ransom in the event of a ransomware attack?
    
- Are there exclusions (e.g., if the ransom goes to a sanctioned entity, or if backups are available but unused)?
    

### üßë‚Äçüíª Third-Party Breach

- Does the policy cover **losses caused by a breach at a third-party service provider**?
    
- Many organizations rely on cloud providers, contractors, and SaaS ‚Äî it‚Äôs critical to understand if those are included.
    

### ü§ù Proactive Support

- What **assistance does the insurance company provide before an incident** occurs?  
    (e.g., risk assessments, training, policy reviews)
    
- Is the organization **required to accept this assistance** as a condition of the policy?
    

### üö® Incident Reporting & Assistance

- What **notification requirements** exist? (e.g., how quickly must the organization inform the insurer after an incident?)
    
- Does the insurance company select the forensic investigator, or can the organization choose its own?
    
- Will the insurer cover legal, PR, or notification costs associated with the incident?
    

---

## üìù Summary Table

|**Aspect**|**Questions to Ask**|
|---|---|
|üéØ **Ransomware**|When and how will ransom payments be covered?|
|üîó **Third-party Breach**|Are losses from vendor/service provider breaches included?|
|‚öôÔ∏è **Proactive Support**|Does the insurer offer/require risk reduction support before incidents?|
|üö® **Incident Reporting**|What are the deadlines and who chooses response vendors?|

---

üí° **Strategist‚Äôs Advice:**  
A cyber-insurance policy should **complement, not replace**, robust security controls and risk management practices.  
It‚Äôs also essential to ensure that the organization meets all **preconditions and compliance obligations** specified in the policy to avoid denied claims


# üìÑ Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

The practice of identifying, assessing, and managing the risks associated with **outsourcing to external organizations** (called _third parties_) is known as **third-party risk management**.

In legal or contractual language:

- The **organization** (you) = _first party_
    
- The **service provider/vendor** = _third party_
    
- Any vendors or subcontractors they engage = _fourth parties_
    

A security strategist reviewing the program should look for the following **good practices**:

---

## üîç Key Practices in TPRM

### ‚úÖ 1. Up-Front Due Diligence

Before entering into a relationship, the organization conducts a **risk assessment of the service provider**.  
This is crucial to identify potential risks early and to build appropriate **security terms and conditions into the legal agreement**.

#### Types of Up-Front Risk Assessments:

- üìà **Relationship Risk Assessment**  
    Evaluates the **strategic importance** of the service provider based on:
    
    - Contract value
        
    - Criticality of the service to operations
        
- üí∞ **Inherent Risk Assessment**  
    Reviews factors external to the service itself:
    
    - Financial health of the provider
        
    - Geopolitical risks in the regions they operate in
        
- üîê **Control Risk Assessment**  
    Examines the **security controls** that the organization requires the service provider to implement (to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance).
    
- üè¢ **Site Visit**  
    The organization may physically visit one or more of the provider‚Äôs **processing sites and offices**, especially for high-risk or critical services, to validate claims and assess controls in practice.
    

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Risk Tiering

Service providers are classified into **tiers based on their risk level**.  
This ensures that the **effort and scrutiny are proportional to the risk** they pose.

#### Example of Tiered Approach:

|**Risk Tier**|Due Diligence Activities|
|---|---|
|üî¥ High|Annual detailed questionnaire, penetration test, on-site visit, mitigation plan if gaps are found|
|üü° Medium|Shorter annual questionnaire, review of certifications|
|üü¢ Low|Brief annual questionnaire, minimal follow-up|

**Note:** The level of response to inadequate answers also varies by tier ‚Äî top-tier providers may require a **formal remediation plan**, while lower-tier providers might only need clarification or acknowledgment.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Ongoing Due Diligence

Risk management doesn‚Äôt end once the contract is signed.  
Throughout the **entire relationship**, the organization must periodically reassess the service provider to ensure:

- Risks identified at the start have not changed significantly
    
- New risks (e.g., due to changes in the provider‚Äôs business, technology, or regulatory environment) are identified and addressed
    

Ongoing activities often mirror the **up-front due diligence**, adjusted to reflect the current risk tier and relationship maturity.

---

## üìå Why It Matters

Third-party risk is a significant part of organizational risk because sensitive data, critical operations, or compliance obligations may rely on external parties.  
By implementing structured due diligence ‚Äî upfront and ongoing ‚Äî and risk tiering, the organization ensures:

- Better security and compliance
    
- Appropriate resource allocation
    
- Informed decision-making

## üéØ **1. Objective of the Audit**

- Explains **why** the audit was conducted.
    
- Helps understand the **motivation behind the audit**, which can influence its focus and scope.
    
- Common objectives include:
    
    - üìú **Regulatory requirement:** e.g., required by a law, regulation, or compliance framework.
        
    - üîé **Voluntary/Improvement-driven:** initiated internally to identify weaknesses and improve processes.
        
    - üíº **Customer or contractual obligation:** performed to satisfy terms in an agreement.
        
- Knowing the objective also clarifies why certain areas were audited while others were left out.
    

---

## üìù **2. Scope of the Audit**

- Defines **what was included in the audit**.
    
- Tells the reader:
    
    - Which **technologies** (e.g., specific systems, networks, applications)
        
    - Which **business processes** (e.g., procurement, HR, incident response)
        
    - Which **locations** (e.g., headquarters, data centers, remote offices)
        
    - Or which **departments/teams**  
        were examined.
        
- A clear scope ensures the reader knows the **boundaries** of the audit and what was explicitly excluded.
    

---

## üë®‚Äçüíº **3. Qualifications of the Auditors**

- An audit is only as effective as the **skill and experience** of the auditors performing it.
    
- Important factors include:
    
    - Professional experience and credentials (e.g., CISA, CISSP, CPA)
        
    - Familiarity with the **specific domain** being audited (e.g., an IT auditor with hands-on technical experience in IT operations is more likely to provide valuable insights).
        
    - Independence and objectivity of the auditors also matter.
        

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **4. Audit Methodologies**

- Explains **how** the audit was conducted.
    
- Methodologies might include:
    
    - üìã **Interviews:** speaking with staff to understand processes and controls.
        
    - üñ•Ô∏è **System and record examination:** reviewing configurations, logs, or documentation.
        
    - üëÄ **Observation:** watching personnel perform their daily tasks.
        
    - üîç **Testing:** auditors themselves perform specific tasks to verify controls.
        
- üìä **Sampling Methodologies:**
    
    - Describes how the auditors selected which records, transactions, or activities to examine.
        
    - Ensures that the samples are representative and unbiased.
        
    - Important to know **who selected the samples** and the rationale behind the selection.



# üìã Gap Assessment: Key Aspects of a Security Program to Review

When conducting a **gap assessment**, a security manager or strategist should evaluate multiple facets of the security program to identify strengths, weaknesses, and misalignments. Below are the aspects to consider:

---

## üî∑ Business Alignment

- Most critical element: does the security program align with business objectives and strategy?
    
- A well-aligned program supports and enables the business, not just compliance.
    

---

## üî∑ Existing / Previous Strategy

Understanding the history of security strategies reveals the program‚Äôs maturity and direction.  
Questions to consider:

- Was the prior ‚Äústrategy‚Äù actually a strategy, or merely an objective, roadmap, or set of initiatives?
    
- Was it realistic and achievable?
    
- Was progress made, and was it fully or partially achieved?
    
- Was it business-aligned and measurable?
    
- Were adequate resources allocated to implement it?
    

---

## üî∑ Security Program Charter

- Does the organization have a formal charter outlining the security program's **strategy, roles, responsibilities, and objectives**?
    

---

## üî∑ Security Policy

- Assess alignment between policy and strategy.
    
- Review policy enforcement, exceptions, and incidents.
    
- Determine if policies are relevant and practical.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Standards

- Examine the emphasis on consistency and proven methods.
    
- Are standards just guiding principles, or do they include specific configuration and implementation details?
    

---

## üî∑ Security Procedures & Guidelines

- Review both security-specific and business/IT procedures that impact security.
    
- Evaluate how guidelines interpret policies and reflect organizational culture.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Controls

- Review objectives, narratives, and effectiveness of implemented controls.
    
- Determine whether they genuinely support security objectives.
    

---

## üî∑ Risk Assessments

- Assess what risk assessments reveal about organizational risk posture.
    
- Are they recent? Comprehensive? Actionable?
    

---

## üî∑ Internal and External Audit Results

- Audit reports provide deep insights into control effectiveness.
    
- Understand not just the findings, but also the scope and methodologies used.
    
- Recognize that some audits may focus narrowly and not cover all risks.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Metrics

- Review metrics over time for trends and effectiveness.
    
- Note which metrics were chosen, as they reflect what the organization values.
    
- Trends may indicate improvement, stagnation, or decline.
    

---

## üî∑ Risk Register

- Review the register to understand key risks, treatments, and organizational priorities.
    
- Completeness of the register indicates the maturity of risk-based management.
    

---

## üî∑ Risk Treatment Decision Records

- Evaluate records documenting how identified risks were discussed and addressed.
    
- Together with the risk register, these show how risk decisions were made.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Incident Program

- Assess program objectives, processes, tools, records, and practices.
    
- Look for the presence of playbooks for consistent response.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Incident Records

- A rich record of incidents indicates robust detection and response.
    
- Sparse records may signal underreporting, poor detection, or lack of engagement.
    

---

## üî∑ Third-Party (Vendor) Risk Management

- Review how much attention is given to vendor risk:
    
    - Completeness of records
        
    - Frequency and depth of assessments
        
    - History of site visits
        
    - Follow-up on discovered issues
        
- Third-party risk is critical due to widespread outsourcing and cloud use.
    

---

## üî∑ Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Programs

- Review BCP/DRP records and procedures.
    
- Check if they are up-to-date, tested, and supported by trained personnel.
    

---

## üî∑ Security Awareness Training Program

- Assess whether the program aligns with organizational needs.
    
- Variety, frequency, and techniques used are important, but alignment is critical.
    

---

## üî∑ IT and Security Projects

- Review recent projects for evidence of security involvement:
    
    - Were security personnel included?
        
    - Were security requirements documented and implemented?
- # üìã Standards in Information Security Governance

## üìÑ Relationship Between Policies and Standards

- **Policies** ‚Üí Define _what_ must be done.
    
    - Example: _‚ÄúStrong passwords must be used for end-user authentication.‚Äù_
        
    - Designed to be broad, durable, and long-lasting.
        
    - Typically less specific to allow flexibility over time.
        
- **Standards** ‚Üí Define _how_ to implement policies.
    
    - Example: A password standard specifies the exact _length, complexity, and rules_ for strong passwords.
        
    - More specific and technical.
        
    - Change more frequently than policies because they are closer to the technology and implementation details.
        

---

## üìå Importance of Developing Standards Carefully

When developing standards, keep these principles in mind:  
‚úÖ Accurately reflect the intent of the corresponding policy or policies.  
‚úÖ Be practical and feasible to implement within the organization.  
‚úÖ Be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for conflicting interpretations.  
‚úÖ Support automation wherever possible ‚Äî this improves consistency and scalability when applied to many systems, devices, or people.

---

## üî∑ Types of Standards

Several categories of standards are used in organizations, each serving different purposes:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Protocol Standards**

- Define specific technical protocols to use.
    
- Examples:
    
    - TLS 1.2 ‚Äî for encrypting web sessions.

### üìå 5. **Requirements**

- Lists the required characteristics and components of the solution.
    
- These are the minimum functional and technical needs to move from the current state to the desired state.
    

---

### üìå 6. **Approach**

- Describes the proposed steps to achieve the desired future state.
    
- May include:
    
    - Alternatives considered and reasons for rejecting them.
        
    - If the initiative involves procurement of products or professional services:
        
        - It may include vendor proposals.
            
        - Or include a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Information (RFI) to be sent to selected vendors for additional details.
