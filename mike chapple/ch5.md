## 📌 Defining Program Scope

The first step in developing an information security program is creating a **clear scope statement** — defining what **is** and **is not** included.

### Two key elements of the scope:

- **Security Objectives:**
    
    - Does the program include all aspects of information security?
        
    - Are there exceptions (e.g., physical security, paper records handled by other teams)?
        
- **Organizational Coverage:**
    
    - Does the program cover the **entire organization** or only a specific unit?
        

### Examples of Scope Statements:

✅ Broad scope:

> The information security program is responsible for securing the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of all information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization in any form: physical or digital.

✅ Digital-only scope:

> The information security program is responsible for securing the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of all information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization **in digital form**.

✅ Scope with exclusions:

> The information security program is responsible for securing the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of all information stored, processed, or transmitted by the organization in any form: physical or digital.  
> **The program does not apply to elements of the University Health System governed by the UHS Cybersecurity Program.**

In most cases, the scope statement should be **concise and clear**, understandable to all employees.

## 📌 Developing a Program Charter

The **charter** is the organizing document for the cybersecurity program — it builds on the scope and outlines the parameters of the program.

### Common Components of a Charter:

- **Scope Statement:**
    
    - Reiterates the program’s scope in an accessible location for stakeholders.
        
- **Business Purpose:**
    
    - Clearly links **security objectives** to **business objectives**.
        
    - Example (University of Pennsylvania):
        
        > Penn is committed to preeminence in research, teaching, and service.  
        > Penn owns significant informational assets, such as student records, employment records, financial info, research data, health information, intellectual property, etc.  
        > Improper use, unauthorized disclosure, or interruption of these assets can disrupt Penn’s mission and create regulatory, legal, financial, and reputational risks.
        
- **Statement of Authority:**
    
    - Delegates institutional authority to a **specific individual** or role.
        
    - Example (Wayne State University):
        
        > The Sr. Director of Information Security (Chief Information Security Officer) under the division of Computing & Information Technology is designated as the Program Officer responsible for coordinating and overseeing the Information Security Program.  
        > The Program Officer may designate others to oversee portions of the program.
        
- **Roles and Responsibilities:**
    
    - Identifies other key stakeholders:
        
        - Senior leaders
            
        - Information security team members
            
        - Other technologists
## 📌 Additional Components of a Program Charter

Beyond the core elements, the charter may also include the following components:

### 👥 Stakeholders and Roles

- **Internal and External Auditors**
    
- **Data Owners, Stewards, and Custodians**
    
- **Other Employees and Stakeholders**
    
    - Defines their responsibilities and expectations in supporting the information security program.
        

### 🏛 Governance

- **Governance Structure and Processes**
    
    - Ensures the information security program remains aligned with the organization’s business goals over time.
        

### 📄 Program Documentation

- **Documentation Procedures**
    
    - Specifies how the organization will establish, communicate, and maintain:
        
        - Information security standards
            
        - Guidelines
            
        - Procedures
            
        - Other supporting documentation
            

### 🚨 Enforcement

- **Enforcement Mechanisms**
    
    - Defines how compliance with policies will be monitored and enforced.
        
    - Includes consequences for individuals or units that fail to comply with the program’s requirements.
        

### 🔍 Review and Improvement

- **Periodic Review Process**
    
    - Ensures the program:
        
        - Continues to meet security objectives.
            
        - Remains aligned with evolving business objectives.
            
        - Functions effectively and adapts as needed.
            

### ✅ Approval and Authority

- **Approval Statement**
    
    - Clearly states the authority under which the program is enacted.
        
    - Typically signed by the **CEO or another senior leader**, giving formal authority and legitimacy to the charter and its delegation of responsibilities.


# Information Security Program Metrics

## 📌 Key Metrics

Metrics help assess and guide the security program by measuring performance, progress, and risk.

### 1️⃣ **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

- **Definition:**  
    Metrics that measure the program’s success in achieving its defined objectives.  
    → Typically reflect _past performance_ (look back).
    
- **Purpose:**  
    To evaluate whether the program has met its goals.
    
- **Examples (from ITIL):**
    
    - % decrease in security breaches reported to the service desk.
        
    - % decrease in the impact of security breaches.
        
    - % increase in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with appropriate security clauses.
        
    - Number of preventive security measures implemented in response to threats.
        
    - Time elapsed between identifying a threat and implementing controls.
        
    - Number of major security incidents.
        
    - Number of incidents causing service outages or impairments.
        
    - Number of security testing, training, and awareness events conducted.
        
    - Number of shortcomings identified during security tests.

### 2️⃣ **Key Goal Indicators (KGIs)**

- **Definition:**  
    Metrics that measure _progress toward specific goals_.  
    → More forward-looking than KPIs.
    
- **Example:**  
    If the goal is to eliminate stored Social Security Numbers (SSNs), a KGI could track:
    
    > % of SSNs that have been removed from storage.
    

---

### 3️⃣ **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**

- **Definition:**  
    Metrics that quantify the **future risk** facing the organization.  
    → _Look forward_, predicting potential threats or vulnerabilities.
    
- **Purpose:**  
    To highlight areas where risk may jeopardize future security.
    
- **ISACA’s Criteria for Selecting KRIs:**
    
    - **Impact:**  
        Likelihood that the indicator identifies significant business risks.
        
    - **Effort:**  
        Resources required to implement, measure, and maintain the indicator.
        
    - **Reliability:**  
        How well the indicator predicts risk.
        
    - **Sensitivity:**  
        Ability to detect meaningful variations in risk

# Information Security Program Budgeting

## 📌 Budget Definition

- A **budget** is a **financial plan** for the team.
    
- It outlines:
    
    - How much money is available over the year.
        
    - How you plan to spend that money.
        

---

## 📌 Budgeting Approaches

### 1️⃣ **Incremental Budgeting**

- Starts with the **prior year’s budget** and adjusts it up or down.
    
- Common in organizations where you might hear:
    
    > “We have a 3% budget increase this year”  
    > “We’re cutting the budget by 5%.”
    
- Managers must advocate for additional funds and adjust to meet new targets.
    

### 2️⃣ **Zero-Based Budgeting**

- Starts from **zero each year**.
    
- Managers must **justify the entire budget** from scratch — no assumptions that prior year funding will continue.
    

---

## 📌 Expense Categories

### 🏗 **Capital Expenses (CapEx)**

- Costs incurred when building or maintaining **large assets**.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Purchasing/renovating buildings
        
    - Buying expensive computing equipment
        
    - Buying vehicles
        
    - Purchasing multifunction printers
        

### ⚙️ **Operational Expenses (OpEx)**

- Day-to-day costs of **running the business** — not tied to buying or maintaining assets.
    
- Examples:
    
    - Payroll (employees are not financial assets)
        
    - Electricity costs
        
    - Hardware maintenance agreements
        
    - Office supplies
