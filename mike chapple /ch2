Governance programs are the sets of procedures and controls put in place to allow an organization to effectively direct its work.

Business use cases  typically include several core components:
• A scope statement that concisely describes the proposed initiative
• The strategic context that demonstrates the need for the initiative and how the investment aligns with the organization's broader strategic goals
• A cost analysis that outlines the financial and human resource costs of the initiative, on both a one-time and a recurring basis
• An evaluation of alternatives that describes other possible approaches for achieving the strategic goals addressed by this project and explains why the current proposal is the best available option
• A project plan that describes the detailed implementation plan for the initiative
• A management plan that describes how the organization will oversee the processes created by this initiative on an ongoing basis in a manner thaintegrates with the information security and corporate governance frameworks

Master service agreements (MSAs) provide an umbrella contract for the work that a vendor does with an organization over an extended period of time. The MSA typically includes detailed security and privacy requirements. Each time the organization enters into a new project with the vendor, they may then create a statement of work (SOW) that contains project-specific details and references the MSA.

Service-level agreements (SLAs) are written contracts that specify the conditions of service that will be provided by the vendor and the remedies available to the customer if the vendor fails to meet the SLA. SLAs commonly cover issues such as system availability, data durability, and response time.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a letter written to document aspects of the relationship. MOUs are an informal mechanism that allows the parties to document their relationship to avoid future misunderstandings. MOUs are commonly used in cases where an internal service provider is offering a service to a customer that is in a different business unit of the same company.

Business partnership agreements (BPAs) exist when two organizations agree to do business with each other in a partnership. For example, if two companies jointly develop and market a product, the BPA might specify each partner's responsibilities and the division of profits.
  
Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) protect the confidentiality of information used in the relationship. NDAs may be mutual, protecting the confidentiality of information belonging to both parties in the relationship, or one-way, protecting the confidential

information security policy framework contains a series of documents designed to describe the organization's cybersecurity program. The scope and complexity of these documents vary widely, depending on the nature of the organization and its information resources. These frameworks generally include four different types of document:
• Policies
• Standards
• Procedures
• Guidelines

Policies are broad statements of management intent. Compliance with policies is mandatory. An information security policy will generally contain generalized statements about cybersecurity objectives, including the following:
• A statement of the importance of cybersecurity to the organization
• Requirements that all staff and contracts take measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems
• Statement on the ownership of information created and/ or possessed by the organization
• Designation of the CISO or other individual as the executive responsible for cybersecurity issues
• Delegation of authority granting the CISO the ability to create standards, procedures, and guidelines that implement the policy

Standards provide mandatory requirements describing how an organization will carry out its information security policies.

Procedures are detailed, step-by-step processes that individuals and organizations must follow in specific circumstances.

Monitoring procedures that describe how the organization will perform security monitoring activities, including the possible use of continuous monitoring technology
Evidence production procedures that describe how the organization will respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legitimate requests to produce digital evidence
Patching procedures that describe the frequency and process of applying patches to applications and systems under the organization's care

Guidelines provide best practices and recommendations related to a given concept, technology, or task.

The state of Washington uses an exception process that requires the requestor document the following information:
• Standard/ requirement that requires an exception
• Reason for noncompliance with the requirement
• Business and/ or technical justification for the exception
• Scope and duration of the exception

Risks associated with the exception
Description of any supplemental controls that mitigate the risks associated with the exception
Plan for achieving compliance
Identification of any unmitigated risks

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) includes one of the most formal compensating control processes in use today. It sets out three criteria that must be met for a compensating control to be satisfactory:
• The control must meet the intent and rigor of the original requirement.
• The control must provide a similar level of defense as the original requirement such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against.
• The control must be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) includes security and privacy rules that affect health-care providers, health insurers, and health information clearinghouses in the United States. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) provides

##COBIT ISACA promotes the Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT) as an IT management and governance framework. In the most recent version of COBIT from 2019, ISACA includes two sets of foundational principles. These consist of six principles for a governance system within an organization and three for a governance framework covering many organizations.

“Each enterprise needs a governance system to satisfy stakeholder needs and to generate value from the use of information and technology. A governance system for enterprise information and technology is built from a number of components that can be of different types and work together in a holistic way.
A governance system should be dynamic.
A governance system should clearly distinguish between governance and management activities and structures.
A governance system should be tailored to the enterprise's needs.
A governance system should cover the enterprise end-to-end, focusing not only on the IT function but on all technology and information processing the enterprise puts in place to achieve its goals.”
These six concepts define crucial characteristics of IT governance.
  From these, ISACA defines three principles for IT governance frameworks that describe how frameworks should be designed:
• “A governance framework should be based upon a conceptual model, identifying the key components and relationships among components, to maximize consistency and allow automation.
• A governance framework should be open and flexible. It should allow the addition of new content and the ability to address new issue in the most flexible way, while maintaining integrity and consistency.
• A governance framework should align to relevant major related standards, frameworks, and regulations.”
  
ISACA designed COBIT to follow these principles and focuses on the ability of an organization to achieve objectives that fall within five domains:
• Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM) objectives provide for effective IT governance and the selection and monitoring of strategic goals.
• Align, Plan, and Organize (APO) objectives describe how the IT function should be organized and how it should structure its work.
• Build, Acquire, and Implement (BAI) objectives describe how the ITorganization should create and acquire new information systems and integrate them into the business.
Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS) objectives describe how the organization should manage the operational tasks of information technology.
Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA) objectives describe how the organization should measure its effectiveness against performance targets, control objectives, and any external requirements it faces.

Each of these domains is broken into very specific objectives that are described in the COBIT 2019 Core Model. The organization meets these objectives by creating a governance system that consists of seven major components:
• Processes
• Services, infrastructure, and applications
• People, skills, and competencies
• Culture, ethics, and behavior
• Information
• Principles, policies, and procedures
• Organizational structures



NIST Cybersecurity Framework implementation tiers
Tier 1: Partial
Tier 2: Risk Informed
Tier 3: Repeatable
Tier 4: Adaptive
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides organizations with a sound approach to developing and evaluating the state of their cybersecurity programs.

NIST Risk Management Framework In addition to the CSF, NIST publishes a Risk Management Framework (RMF). The RMF is a mandatory standard for federal agencies that provides a formalized process that federal agencies must follow to select, implement, and assess risk-based security and privacy controls.

ISO 27001, ISO 27002, ISO 27004, ISO 27701, and ISO 31000.

ISO 27001 is a standard titled “Information technology— Security techniques— Information security management systems— Requirements.”
This standard includes control objectives covering 14 categories:
• Information security policies
• Organization of information security
• Human resource security
• Asset management
• Access control
• Cryptography
• Physical and environmental security
• Operations security
• Communications security
• System acquisition, development, and maintenance
• Supplier relationships
• Information security incident management
• Information security aspects of business continuity management
• Compliance with internal requirements, such as policies, and with external requirements, such as laws

ISO 27002 goes beyond control objectives and describes the actual controls that an organization may implement to meet cybersecurity objectives. ISO designed this supplementary document for organizations that wish to:
• Select information security controls
• Implement information security controls
• Develop information security management guidelines

ISO 27004 helps organizations implement a consistent process for the monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation of its information security

ISO 27701 contains standard guidance for managing privacy controls. ISO views this document as an extension to their ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 security standards.
Exam Note: Be careful with the numbering of the ISO standards, particularly ISO 27001 and ISO 27701. They look nearly identical, but it is important to remember that ISO 27001 covers cybersecurity and ISO 27701 covers privacy.

ISO 31000 provides guidelines for risk management programs.

Audits are formal reviews of an organization's security program or specific compliance issues conducted on behalf of a third party.
There are three different categories of SOC assessment:
• SOC 1: impacts financial reporting
• SOC 2: assesses confidentiality, integrity, and availability (confidential reports)
• SOC 3: same as SOC 2 but intended for public disclosure
There are two types of SOC reports:
• Type 1: assesses controls as of a specific date
• Type 2: assesses operating effectiveness over a period of time

Assessments are less formal reviews of security controls that are typically requested by the security organization itself in an effort to engage in process improvemen
