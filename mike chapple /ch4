where individuals and groups seek out their own technology solutions, is a phenomenon known as shadow IT. Shadow IT poses a risk to the organization because it puts sensitive information in the hands of vendors outside of the organization's control.

ThreatConnect uses six levels of confidence: 
Confirmed (90– 100) uses independent sources or direct analysis to prove that the threat is real.
  Probable (70– 89) relies on logical inference but does not directly confirm the threat.
  Possible (50– 69) is used when some information agrees with the analysis but the assessment is not confirmed. 
  Doubtful (30– 49) is assigned when the assessment is possible but not the most likely option, or the assessment cannot be proven or disproven by the information that is available. 
  Improbable (2– 29) means that the assessment is possible but is not the most logical option, or it is refuted by other information that is available.
  Discredited (1) is used when the assessment has been confirmed to be inaccurate or incorrect.
